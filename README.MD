# MRSE - MRS Extractor
---
This is a very simple utility that has a single purpose to extract Official GunZ Clients.
This has no command line arguments and it can not repack them.
Place it in the root of the GunZ Directory and run it, everything will be dumped to the output directory.
This should be compatible with everything from the original Netmarble Clients to Masangsoft's current Steam Clients.

**NOTE:** This was mostly an attempt to try to understand Rust and to be honest I'm not sure I really do.
